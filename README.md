* ATLAS v2.0 is comprised of a Training Dataset (n=655), Testing Dataset (n=300), and a Generalizability Dataset (completely hidden test dataset; n=316)
* The public release (n=955) includes the Training Dataset (T1w MRIs + lesion masks) and Testing Dataset (T1s MRIs only)
* Preprocessed dataset (n=955) archived on INDI: http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/retro/atlas.html
* Raw, native space dataset (n=955) archived on ICPSR: https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ADDEP/studies/36684/versions/V4
* Hidden lesion masks from the Testing Dataset, and the full Generalizability Dataset, are only available to lesion segmentation challenges upon request
* Check out our current segmentation challenge: https://atlas.grand-challenge.org/

## Anatomical Tracings of Lesions After Stroke - Release 1.1
* Read about ATLAS 1.0 in our Scientific Data paper (Liew et al., 2018): https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201811
* Full dataset (native n=304 | subset in standard space n=239): http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/36684
